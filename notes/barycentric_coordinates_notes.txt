Barycentric Coordinates

to express a point relative to a set of reference points

1D barycentric coordinates: suppose A,B \in real numbers
given a point P we can express P as alpha * A + beta * B, a weighted combination of the two reference points

origins: greek word for heavy, used in center of mass computations
    barycenter: if we placed alpha kg at A, and beta kg at B, the barycenter would be point P.
        note that if we placed c*alpha kg at A, and c*beta kg at B, the barycenter would remain as P.
        convention: alpha + beta = 1 to get rid of non-uniqueness
        this means that P must be between A and B, unless we can put negative kg at point A or B.

two systems of equations:
    1 = alpha + beta
    P = alpha*A + beta*B

we can substitute and solve for alpha and beta
P - beta*B = alpha*A -> (P - beta*B)/A = alpha
beta = 1 - alpha

substitute second into first: P = alpha*A + (1-alpha)*B -> P = alpha*A + B - alpha*B -> P - B = alpha*(A-B) -> (P-B)/(A-B) = alpha
substitute that into second: beta = 1 - (P-B)/(A-B)

NOTE: alpha and beta can be negative, but if either are negative, then one coordinate is negative

to determine if any point P is inside a triangle
